# Description:

This application (still heavily under construction) will contain the following modules: 
* Manage my media files (store their location and information in a database and create interfaces to play them)
* Control multiple VLC Players through a custom interface using VLC's http API
* Control the server running the application (shutdown, suspend, lock screen, unlock screen, etc)
* Login system
* Application administration view (secured through Spring Security)
* About and contact us
* Newsletter functionality
* Test API endpoints to practice different frontend frameworks
* Integration with social networks and other popular APIs

The main idea of this application is to keep improving and learning best practices of software development with Java and frontend technologies, so if you are a software developer and can look through the code and see vulnerabilities or things to improve I'd be more than happy to hear about them!

The project uses **Maven** as a **SCM**. It is configured to validate the test coverage with **cobertura**, validate code with **findbugs** and the style with **checkstyle**.

##### Java frameworks/libraries:
* Spring
* Spring Security
* Hibernate
* Hsqldb
* Ehcache

##### Javascript frameworks/libraries:
* Angular
* jQuery

##### SCM:
* Maven 
* Trello for organizing development tasks

# Compilation:

- Compile using `mvn clean install [compilation option]`.

| Compilation option | Usage | Description | 
| ------------------ | ----- | ----------- |
| -P | -P:prod -P:qa -P:dev | Default profile is prod. It uses mysql. qa uses oracle and dev uses hsql in memory db |

*********************
# Execution in eclipse:
- To run from eclipse, deploy into a configured tomcat server inside eclipse.

*************
# Installation:
- Deploy copying the war into the webapps directory of your tomcat installation

*************
# External dependencies:
This web application interacts with other applications that need to be installed on the server to execute certain functionality. These external dependencies are:

- VLC Player (https://www.videolan.org/)
- VNC Server. Any vnc server will do (https://www.tightvnc.com/)
- VNCDoTool (https://github.com/sibson/vncdotool)
- gnome-screensaver-command in Ubuntu (http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/gnome-screensaver-command.1.html)

The application will load even without these installed, however some functionality will not work without them.

*********************
# Live demo:

This application is hosted in https://www.nicobrest.com/kame-house/ so you can check it out and play around with it and report any issues :) It's hosted in an Amazon AWS Free Tier EC2 Ubuntu 18 running with mysql. Most of the external dependencies are not installed though and it's not configured to execute shutdown or lock commands. So you can test the UI (remember I'm a backend developer :p) and some of the functionality in the VLC player and test module with some limitations. For example, AWS EC2 Ubuntu's kernel isn't compiled with audio modules (not even dummy), so audio will always revert to 0%, even if you update it with the buttons or slider.

The responsive layout was developed and tested for Samsung S8, Note8+ (and Pixel 2 using chrome dev tools). It's neither tested nor supported in other mobile devices. It was also tested mainly on Chrome and Firefox on desktop. It most certainly needs several more breakpoints and fixes for other devices and browsers.

# Other notes:

### Setup/Troubleshoot linux commands:
- Make sure the user running tomcat has sudo set for the commands that require it in CommandLine.java. I tried setting those without sudo and they don't work (tested on Ubuntu 16).

### Setup/Troubleshoot VLC start and stop commands:
- Make sure vlc executable is in the user's PATH. In linux it's added by default when vlc is installed. In windows I need to manually add the path to the executable to my user's PATH environment variable. To test that it works, open a command prompt and type vlc to see if it finds the executable or if it throws an error that it can't find it.

- The commands to start and stop vlc (and possibly other system commands) don't work if tomcat is run as a service in windows, even if it's configured to run as a service with my user. To fix this, uninstall the service. Download tomcat and extract it to $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat. Add a shortcut to the $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.bat script in the windows startup folder (Currently in windows 10 it's $HOME\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) so tomcat runs when I logon. Edit the windows shortcut and in the field 'Start in' change from $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/bin to $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat otherwise it will create the application logs in $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/bin/logs instead of $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/logs

- To make the command windows start minimized, update catalina.bat and in the line where it says 'set _EXECJAVA=start "%TITLE%" %_RUNJAVA%' add /min after the start: 'set _EXECJAVA=start /min "%TITLE%" %_RUNJAVA%'

- For the vlc start and stop (and possibly other system commands) to work in Linux, if I have any tomcat installed as a service, run sudo apt-get remove tomcatX, sudo apt-get purge tomcatX, remove everything. Download the zip or tar.gz from the tomcat website, unpack it in $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat and start it with $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/bin/startup.sh. Tomcat should start with my current user and the command to start and stop vlc should work. 
- To run on startup, with my current user, create a script where I cd to $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat (TOMCAT_HOME) and then run ./bin/startup.sh in that script. I need to do it this way because I need to be on $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat when I run startup.sh. If I run the script from $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/bin, it will create the application logs in $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/bin/logs instead of $HOME/programs/apache-tomcat/logs. Then edit my cron jobs with 'crontab -e' and add the following entry: 
'@reboot /bin/bash /PATH-TO-MY-SCRIPT/tomcat-startup.sh'
- Also update the script startup.sh and as the second line add 'export DISPLAY=:0' otherwise vlc start will fail because DISPLAY env variable won't be set at reboot time when tomcat is being started. I don't need to set it if I run startup.sh from my desktop but if I schedule it with cron, startup.sh needs to be updated with that export.

### Setup/Troubleshoot lock, unlock and wake-up screen commands:
- Setup a vnc server (I use tightvnc on windows and the native desktop sharing tool in ubuntu) running in the same server as the application. Unlock screen is done through vncdotool.
- Install vncdotool (follow https://vncdotool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) in the same server that runs the application. Test it to make sure you can execute commands through it using the command line.
- Encode user password with base64 for the user and store it in a file specified by the property unlock.screen.pwd.file. This file should be readable only by the user, hidden from anyone else. The application will decode and type this password to unlock the screen.
- If the vnc server is configured with a password (it should!), also set the file pointed by vnc.server.pwd.file with the vnc server password encoded. This password will be used by vncdo to execute the commands through vnc. Again, this file contains an encoded password so it should be only readable by the user owning this process.
- Make sure vncdo in installed to /usr/local/bin/vncdo in linux or update CommandLine.java to point to where it is installed. Using just vncdo without the absolute path got me command not found. It needs the absolute path or some other fix.
- Using a vnc server and vncdotool is the only way I found to unlock the screen remotely on windows 10 (also works on ubuntu). If you are reading this and have a better solution, please contact me.
- Lock screen command on linux relies on gnome-screensaver-command to do the lock. Install it with sudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver. The command line could easily be changed to use vncdo and hotkeys to lock the screen for other linux versions (tested on ubuntu 16).
